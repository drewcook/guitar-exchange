# Guitar Exchange
Guitar Exchange is a mobile-responsive web application that acts as a marketplace for guitarists to lend out their own and borrow others' guitars for specified dates.  This helps solve the problem for gigging guitarists that happen to need to borrow a guitar for a night or two, and at the same time, it also allows guitarists to earn some extra cash by lending out that guitar that is sitting in the closet and not getting played.

Guitar Exchange is an app built in the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) framework and written mostly in [Vue](https://vuejs.org).  It incorporates the [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) component library to assist in building out the UI.
